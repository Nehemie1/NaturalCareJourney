<h3><center> What are the Different Types of Skin?</center></h3>
<p><b> Dry Skin</b>: an uncomfortable condition marked by scaling, itching, and cracking. It can occur for a variety of reasons. Your skin may feel uncomfortably tight if you have dry skin.</p>
<p><b> Oily Skin</b>: acne-prone skin with open pores and a shiny complexion. Oily skin tends to feel greasy and slick to the touch. </p>
<p><b> Combination Skin</b>: simply having oily skin in some areas of your face and dry skin in other areas. Typically, there's a mix of oily and dry areas on different parts of your face, with the t-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) being slightly to very oily and your cheek areas being slighty dry.</p>
<p><b> Sensitive Skin</b>: a range of conditions, from genetic ailments, such as rosacea and eczema, to severe allergies. You may have persistent reactions with certain products and ingredients.</p>
<p><b> Aging Skin</b>: skin changes as you age. You might notice wrinkles, age spots and dryness. Your skin also becomes thinner and loses fat, making it less plump and smooth. A major cause of skin aging is sunlight. </p>
